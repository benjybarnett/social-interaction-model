MATLAB code for a novel adaptation of the Froese, T., &amp; Di Paolo, E. A. (2008, July) paper.

A novel adaptation of the paper: Froese, T., & Di Paolo, E. A. (2008, July). Stability of coordination requires mutuality 
of interaction in a model of embodied agents. In International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (pp. 52-61).
Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.

The paper is adapted to include multiple agents. Scripts are included to run the Genetic Algorithms to evolve the 
minimally embodied agents, to run the task and to perform experiments to test the specific hypotheses expounded in the
project report.
